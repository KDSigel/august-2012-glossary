# ASYNC / AWAIT

## DEFINITION

Act as "syntactic sugar" on top of promises, making asynchronous code easier to write and to read afterwards. Replaces .then blocks.

## HOW IT WORKS / WHAT IT WORKS WITH

- The async keyword, which you put in front of a function declaration to turn it into an async function. An async function is a function that knows how to expect the possibility of the await keyword being used to invoke asynchronous code.
- Await can be put in front of any async promise-based function to pause your code on that line until the promise fulfills, then return the resulting value. You can use await when calling any function that returns a Promise, including web API functions.
