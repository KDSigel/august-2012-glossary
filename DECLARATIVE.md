# DECLARATIVE

## DEFINITION

Declarative programming is giving the computer commands describing what should be done, instead of how it should be done.

## HOW IT WORKS / WHAT IT WORKS WITH

An example would be using a .map array method to create a new array. This tells the computer what elements in the new array should look like, but it takes care of assembling the array.
