# NODE.JS

## DEFINITION

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime (i.e. a way to convert JavaScript into machine code) that allows developers to use JavaScript outside of the web browser. Originally, JavaScript was invented as a way to add interactivity to websites, but it couldn't be used in other areas like writing programs for operating robotics or interacting with a computer's filesystem. Node.js frees JavaScript from the browser so you can use the language in other domains, like building command-line applications or backend APIs.
